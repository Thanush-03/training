# Content Editing for Plone

About
: How to create and manage content using Plone

Level
: Beginner

Plone is a fully featured web content management system for creating public websites and intranets. It lets you create and organize pages, folders, files, news items, events, almost any type of information you can imagine.

Noteworthy feature of Plone include:
- collaborative editing: support for having multiple editors creating, editing, and managing a website simultaneously
- workflow: content items, when created, are initially in a private state and are not visible to the public, and can be advanced to other states, such as "review" and "published"
- content rules: sets of triggers and actions that can be performed automatically on content items

In this user guide, we will show how to use Plone to create, edit, and manage content.
